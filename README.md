## Installation

To set up and run Kifah locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Expo app installed in your device.

```bash
cd kifah
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the application:

```bash

Note: I suggest using the Development Build because its more stable and no expected bugs. but if the Development build didn't work. use the Expo Go default (thats require Expo app on the target _android_ device)

the APK deveolpment Build: https://expo.dev/accounts/ryzentx/projects/Kifah/builds/a6c074e2-84d5-4efe-b6e8-389ebfbc6939
